# A/B Testing Analysis

This project showcases a basic implementation of A/B Testing using Python to evaluate the performance of two webpage variants based on conversion rates.

## 📌 Objective

To determine whether the new webpage variant (B) performs significantly better than the control (A) in terms of conversion rate, using statistical methods.

## 📊 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conversion rate calculation
- Z-test for proportion comparison
- Confidence interval estimation
- Result interpretation and decision-making

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

The analysis concluded that the variant B had a statistically significant improvement over the control version, aiding data-driven product decisions.
